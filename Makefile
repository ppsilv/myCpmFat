# This is a magic directive which allows GNU Make to perform
# a second expansion of things before running.
#
# In this case we wish to dynamically get the dependencies
# of the given .asm file.  We do that by loading a perl-script
# to look for `include "xxx"` references in the input file,
# and processing them recursively.
#
.SECONDEXPANSION:

#
# Convert an .asm file into a .bin file, via pasmo.
#
# The $$(shell ...) part handles file inclusions, so if you
# were to modify "locatoins.asm", for example, all appropriate
# binary files would be rebuilt.

%.hex: %.asm $$(shell ./gendep %.asm)
