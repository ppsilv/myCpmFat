# Schematics

Only the first page of this schematic is valid, the others were a failed attempt because 
I found several bugs in the backplane, so I made a new assembly with wired up as you can 
see in the photo z80_001.jpg

This version 0.3.2 works well, I added some commands to monitor from  Dean Belfield.

0.3.2 - uart TL16C550CN working very well, bugs fixed.
		i2c driver implemented and tested.
		lcd i2c implemented and tested.
		P8255A implemented and tested.
		MSX rom_ce and ram_ce logic implemented and running, this is more one step toward 
		MSX.
		in the monitor directory I changed the names from *.z80 do *.asm, I am using VScode
		and was so bad coding without color sintax.( Sorry Dean).

0.3.1 - uart TL16C550CN working not so well.
