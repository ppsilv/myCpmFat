 3.   BUG IN LOAD FILE PROCESSOR FIXED.
      THIS BUG CAUSED ALL BUT THE FIRST OF SIMULTANEOUS AUTO OR
      PROGRAM LOAD SEQUENCES TO FAIL IF THE PERMISSIVE COMPATABILITY
      FLAG WAS NOT SET.

 4.   SGLLOG.REL MODULE DELETED.
      THE SINGLE LOGON MODULE CAN NO LONGER BE SUPPORTED DUE
      TO THE MULTIPLE MASTER CAPABILITIES.

 5.   BUG IN LOGON/LOGOFF PROCESSOR FIXED.
      THIS BUG CAUSED ALL FILES IN USER ZERO WITH THE GLOBAL

      IT IS NO LONGER NECESSARY FOR THE DOWNLOAD REQUEST MESSAGE
      HEADER TO HAVE MESSAGE ORIGIN ID SET EQUAL TO THE MESSAGE
      SOURCE ID. THIS DUPLICATION IS NOW TAKEN CARE OF INTERNALLY.

13.   RETURN BUFFER PARAMETERS FUNCTION (FUNCTION 97) NOW RETURNS
      WITH THE A-REGISTER EQUAL TO MEMORY SIZE OF PROCESSOR WHERE
      ORIGINATED, RATHER THAN WHERE THE FUNCTION WAS PROCESSED.

14.   NEW PATCHABLE SYSTEM PARAMETER ADDED (NMBRPS).
      NMBRPS (NUMBER OF REPLY WAITING PACKETS) MAY NOW BE SET TO
      PRE-ALLOCATE REPLY WAITING PACKETS IN THE SAME MANNER AS
      NMBMBS (NUMBER OF MESSAGE BUFFERS) TO PREVENT TRAPPING OF
      DISK BUFFERS.

15.   BUG IN VERIFY COMMAND FIXED.
      THIS BUG CAUSED DUPLICATE MAP ENTRIES TO BE MADE IN THE

22.   PACKAGE COMMAND ADDED. (PACKAGE.COM)
      THE PACKAGE COMMAND IS ESSENTIALLY A MICROSOFT RELOCATABLE FILE
      CONCATENATOR.  COMMAND SYNTAX FOR PACKAGE.COM IS IDENTICAL TO
      THE GEN.COM COMMAND, EXCEPT THE INPUT FILE NAME DEFAULTS TO ".PKG"
      INSTEAD OF ".GEN".  THIS COMMAND MAY BE USED TO CONSTRUCT CUSTOM
      "STD" MODULES, PRE-PACKAGE DRIVER MODULES, ADD ADDITIONAL MODULES
      TO EXISTING "STD" MODULES, ETC.

23.   FIFO MANAGER ENHANCED.
      A RAM FIFO NOT CURRENTLY OPEN BY ANY PROCESS BUT CONTAINING
      RECORDS, WILL HAVE THOSE RECORDS DISCARDED IF EITHER:
      (1).  THE FIFO IS RENAMED.
      (2).  THE FIFO ATTRIBUTE (F1) IS TURNED OFF.

24.   HASHED DIRECTORY SEARCH SUPPORT ADDED.
      DISK DIRECTORIES WILL BE MAINTAINED VIA A HASHING ALGORITHM
      IF SO REQUESTED DURING THE ERASEDIR.COM COMMAND.  WHETHER A
      DIRECTORY IS MAINTAINED VIA HASHING OR NOT IS RECORDED IN
      THE DISK'S DIRECTORY LABEL.  HASHED DIRECTORY DISKS ARE NOT
      COMPATABLE WITH CP/M OR PREVIOUS TURBODOS OPERATING SYSTEM
      RELEASES.  THE DIR.COM COMMAND DISPLAYS A "(H)" BETWEEN THE
      DATE AND TIME FIELDS FOR DISKS WITH HASHED DIRECTORIES.
      HASHING SHOULD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE NON WILD CARD DIRECTORY
      PERFORMANCE ON DISKS WITH LARGE DIRECTORIES.

25.   FIXED MEDIA FLAG ADDED TO DST ENTRY
      BIT SEVEN OF THE ALLOCATION BLOCK SIZE ENTRY OF A DST NOW
      SIGNIFIES THAT THE DISK IS NON-REMOVABLE.  THIS WILL CAUSE
      THE DST ADDRESS TO BE REMEMBERED FOREVER AFTER THE DRIVE IS
      ACCESSED THE FIRST TIME.  MEDIA STATUS DISPLAY HAS BEEN ADDED
      TO THE DRIVE.COM COMMAND

26.   PATCH.REL MODULE LENGTHENED.
      THE PATCH MODULE HAS BEEN LENGTHENED FROM 64 BYTES TO 128 BYTES.

27.   BUG IN OSBOOT.REL FIXED.
      THIS BUG CAUSED THE THE FIRST COPY OF OSLOAD.COM FOUND IN THE
      DIRECTORY TO BE LOADED, WHETHER THE USER NUMBER WAS ZERO OR NOT.

28.   DE-SPOOL MODULE ENHANCED TO PROVIDE IMPROVED PRINTER PERFORMANCE.



              *** RELEASE 1.22 UPDATE INFORMATION ***


 1.   BUG IN COPY COMMAND FIXED.
      THIS BUG CAUSED THE ARCHIVE OPTION TO FAIL TO IGNORE FILES WITH
      THE ARCHIVED ATTRIBUTE SET.

 2.   SPOOLER ENHANCED.
      ON ENCOUNTERING A FULL DISK CONDITION, THE SPOOLER NOW CLOSES
      THE CURRENT PRINT FILE BUT DOES NOT QUEUE IT.  IT THEN DISPLAYS
      AN ERROR MESSAGE AND REQUESTS AND "IGNORE" OR "ABORT" RESPONSE.
      AN "IGNORE" RESPONSE CAUSES THE PRINT MODE TO BE SET TO OFFLINE,
      AND THE APPLICATION PROGRAM TO CONTINUE WITH FURTHER PRINTING
      DISCARDED.  AN "ABORT" RESPONSE CAUSES THE APPLICATION PROGRAM
      TO BE TERMINATED.  A NEW MODULE, "SPLMSG", CONTAINS THE CONSOLE
      HANDLING PORTION OF THIS ENHANCEMENT AND SHOULD ALWAYS BE INCLUDED
      WITH THE "SPOOLR" MODULE.

 3.   DE-SPOOLER ENHANCED.
      ON ENCOUNTERING AN UNRECOVERABLE ERROR, THE DE-SPOOLER NOW ABORTS
      THE CURRENT PRINT JOB AND PLACES THE PRINTER OFF-LINE.  ANY REMAINING
      PRINT JOBS WILL REMAIN QUEUED.

 4.   AUTOLOAD COMMAND ENHANCED.
      THE AUTOLOAD COMMAND WILL NOW ACCEPT MULTIPLE COMMANDS PER LINE.
      THE DEFAULT COMMAND LINE SEPERATOR IS "|" WHICH WILL BE REPLACED
      BY A "\".  ALL AUTOLOAD FILES GENERATED WITH PREVIOUS AUTOLOAD COMMANDS
      MUST BE REGENERATED!

 5.   SYSTEM COMMANDS ENHANCED.
      ALL SYSTEM COMMANDS WILL NOW ACCEPT CONSOLE INPUT FROM DO FILES.

 6.   FLUSH/FREE BUFFERS FUNCTION ENHANCED.
      THE FLUSH/FREE BUFFERS FUNCTION (115) NOW ACCEPTS THE FOLLOWING
      PARAMETERS ON ENTRY:

         E-REGISTER = DRIVE NUMBER (0=A,...15=P)

         D-REGISTER = FLAGS

            BIT
            ---
             7    1 = FREE BUFFER
             6    1 = DISCARD BUFFER AFTER ABORT RESPONSE
             5    1 = CONTINUE AFTER ABORT RESPONSE
             4    1 = RETURN TO CALLER AFTER ABORT RESPONSE

 7.   BUG IN FUNCTION 104 (CP/M 3.0 - MP/M II SET DATE/TIME) FIXED.
      THIS BUG CAUSED SYSTEM TIME SET BY THIS FUNCTION TO BE INCORRECT.

 8.   BUG IN PSA-TO-MICROSOFT CONVERION PROCESSOR (RELCVT.COM) FIXED.
      THIS BUG CAUSED INCORRECT CONVERSION TO OCCUR IN SOME CASES WHERE
      MULTIPLE MODULES WERE ASSEMBLED FROM ONE SOURCE FILE USING THE
      PSA ASSEMBLER ".PRGEND" PSEUDO-OP.

 9.   BUG IN FUNCTION 35 (COMPUTE FILE SIZE) FIXED.

      CIRCUMSTANCES.

10.   BUG IN COPY COMMAND FIXED.
      THIS BUG CAUSED AN "UNABLE TO READ SOURCE FILE" ERROR TO OCCUR IF
      THE SOURCE FILE WAS AN EXACT MULTIPLE OF 128 RECORDS IN LENGTH.

11.   BUG IN FILSUP MODULE FIXED.
      THIS BUG CAUSED INCORRECT OPERATION OF DISK DRIVES WITH CERTAIN
      NUMBERS OF ALLOCATION BLOCKS.

12.   BUG IN NETSVC MODULE FIXED.
      THIS BUG CAUSED IMPROPER OPERATION WITH DIRECT PRINTING WHEN
      IMPLICIT NETWORK FORWARDING WAS INVOLVED.

13.   BUG IN NETREQ MODULE FIXED.
      THIS BUG CAUSED A FAILURE TO PROPERLY DIAGNOSE ACCESSES TO DISK
      DRIVES FROM SLAVES WHERE THE DRIVES WERE MARKED INVALID [0FFH,(0)].
      A "NOT READY ERROR" MESSAGE IS NOW PROPERLY DISPLAYED.

14.   BUG IN SPOOLR MIDULE FIXED.
      THIS BUG CAUSED FUNCTION 17/18 SEQUENCES TO FAIL IF A FUNCTION 5
      CALL WAS ISSUED WHICH RESULTED IN A NEW SPOOLER PRINT FILE BEING
      CREATED.

      FILES LARGER THAN 528K IN LENGTH.

16.   BUG IN NETREQ MODULE FIXED.
      THIS BUG CAUSED COMMUNICATION CHANNEL FUNCTIONS (FUNCTIONS 87-93) AND
      THE USER DEFINED FUNCTION (FUNCTION 127) TO FAIL IF THE DESTINATION
      PROCESSOR (DEFDID) HAD A NETREQ MODULE PRESENT.

17.   BUG IN DSPOOL MODULE FIXED.
      THIS BUG CAUSED THE SYSTEM TO CRASH IF AN ATTEMPT WAS MADE TO CHANGE
      A PRINTER'S QUEUE ASSIGNMENT WHILE THE PRINTER WAS IN STOPPED MODE.

18.   BUG IN BUFMGR MODULE FIXED.
      THIS BUG IS PROBABLY RESPONSIBLE FOR MANY NON-REPRODUCABLE DISK DATA
      AND DIRECTORY ERRORS.  TWO KNOWN EXAMPLES ARE:
         (1). AN ALLOCATION BLOCK ASSIGNED TO TWO FILES AT THE SAME TIME.
         (2). AN ERROR DURING THE CLOSING OF AN EXTENT OR FILE (SOMETIMES
              DURING READ OR WRITE OPERATIONS).

19.   BUG IN DO COMMAND FIXED.
      THIS BUG CAUSED A BAD TEMPORARY FILE NAME TO BE GENERATED IF THE DO
      FILE NAME CONSISTED OF A SINGLE CHARACTER FILE TYPE.

20.   TURBODOS LOADER (OSLOAD.COM) ENHANCED.
      A PATCHABLE SYMBOL (SCANDN) HAS BEEN ADDED TO ALLOW THE LOADER TO SCAN
      FROM DRIVE P DOWNWARD TO DRIVE A INSTEAD OF THE NORMAL UPWARD SCAN.
      SCANDN DEFAULTS TO 0 (FALSE) AND MAY BE PATCHED TO 0FF (TRUE).

21.   BUG IN FILSUP MODULE FIXED.
      THIS BUG CAUSED FILE MANAGEMENT PROBLEMS WITH CERTAIN PATHOLOGOCICALLY
      ORDERED HASHED DIRECTORIES.

      BY A FUNCTION 18 WITH THE FILE NAME REPLACED BY AN AMBIGUOUS
      SPECIFICATION.

24.   RENAME FILE FUNCTION (FUNCTION 23) ENHANCED.
      THE RENAME FILE FUNCTION NOW RESETS THE ARCHIVED (T3) ATTRIBUTE.

25.   FIFO FILE OPERATION ENHANCED.
      (1) FIFO FILES OPENED IN PERMISSIVE MODE ARE NO LONGER LIMITED TO ONE
          WRITING PROCESS.
      (2) FIFO FILES OPENED GLOBALLY ARE NO LONGER FORCED TO READ ONLY STATUS
          WHEN THE GLOBAL WRITE COMPATABILITY FLAG IS FALSE.

26.   THE FOLLOWING IS A RECAP OF PATCHABLE LOCATIONS IN COMMAND FILES.
      (NOTE THAT SOME ARE NEW ADDITIONS).

      AUTOLOAD.COM
         103H   "|"   COMMAND LINE SEPERATOR CHARACTER
